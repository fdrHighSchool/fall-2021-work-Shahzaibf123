# DMV project
## Pair programming
### Goals/What mine entails
Our project was on a U-turn. We made seperate pictures of a car to show the motion of a U-turn.
We figured out how to use `pushMatrix()` and `popMatrix()` in order to keep our different rotations independent from the whole picture.
We created functions to organize our work and had parameters in our `carV2` function.
With more time we could have worked on having each car be seperate and appearing one at a time to seem like an animation. We also could have tried doing it in one swift motion with the `rotate()` function.
