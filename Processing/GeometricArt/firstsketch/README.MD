# Processing First Sketch
## Goals/What I did:
Goal was to make my first sketch on processing. Could have been a shape, logo, anything.
In the code I made a symbol of a diamond. To do this I used the `line()` function the `triangle()` function and the `quad()` function. It was through fixing my mistakes after trying out the codes many times.
