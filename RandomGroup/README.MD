# Randomgame Project
## Goals/What mine contains:
Begin with `import java.util.*;` to import random function.
Create scanner as well. `Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);`
Begins with while loop that has the game in a `game()` function in order to create a replay.
The game has `if` and `else if` statements. The game has different amount of lives for each difficulty and a harder difficulty has a bigger range of random values.
